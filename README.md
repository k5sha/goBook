# GoBook
This project demonstrates how to create a simple but scalable API using Go (Golang), Gin, and GORM. 
It includes endpoints for managing workbooks with functions such as adding, searching, updating, and deleting workbook records. 
The project also integrates PostgreSQL for data storage and uses the Aconfig package for configuration management. 
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to installing and configuring the API via Docker.
