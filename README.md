# GoBook
This project demonstrates how to create a simple but scalable API using Go (Golang), Gin, and GORM. 
It includes endpoints for managing workbooks with functions such as adding, searching, updating, and deleting workbook records. 
The project also integrates PostgreSQL for data storage and uses the Aconfig package for configuration management. 
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to installing and configuring the API via Docker.

### How it works:
- **Gin** is used for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware, making the API fast and efficient. It simplifies tasks like validation and error handling.
- **GORM** is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database, allowing seamless CRUD operations with Go structs instead of raw SQL queries, making database management easier and more efficient.
